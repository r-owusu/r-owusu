    <h2>About me</h2>
   
    <p>I have a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development. With experience in Java, JavaScript, and React, I specialize in building dynamic, user-friendly applications and efficient, scalable backend systems. My expertise extends to Django for web development, and I’m well-versed in integrating APIs, managing databases, and ensuring robust security features.

Throughout my journey, I’ve worked on multiple full-stack projects, including Mozuma Oceanfront Suites, where I led the development of a booking platform that integrates React for the frontend and Django for the backend. I’m also experienced with GitHub for version control, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and DevOps practices to streamline development processes.

I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments and excel in taking on leadership roles while contributing to team success. I approach every project with a problem-solving mindset, ensuring high-quality code that is both maintainable and scalable. I’m constantly learning new technologies and methodologies to stay at the cutting edge of software development.

When I’m not coding, I’m diving into software architecture, performance optimization, and exploring new ways to enhance user experience. Let’s connect and create solutions that make an impact.  </p>
